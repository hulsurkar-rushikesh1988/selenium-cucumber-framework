# Selenium-Cucumber BDD Framework with Gherkin Reusable Steps

## Introduction

This repository contains a sample project demonstrating how to implement a Selenium-Cucumber BDD framework using Gherkin syntax with reusable steps. The framework is designed to facilitate efficient testing of web applications by integrating Selenium WebDriver with Cucumber and organizing test scenarios using Gherkin's human-readable syntax.

## Features

- Integration of Selenium WebDriver for browser automation.
- Utilization of Cucumber for writing feature files in Gherkin syntax.
- Implementation of reusable step definitions for common actions.
- Modular design for easy scalability and maintenance of test suites.
- Flexibility to extend with additional custom steps as per project requirements.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Install JDK 8 or higher.
- **Maven:** Ensure Maven is installed on your system.
- **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** Recommended IDEs include IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code.
- **Web Browser:** Chrome, Firefox, or any other supported browser should be installed.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/selenium-cucumber-bdd.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory:**
   ```
   cd selenium-cucumber-bdd
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Run Tests:**
   ```
   mvn test
   ```

## Project Structure

- **`src/test/java`:** Contains Java source files including step definitions and utility classes.
  - **`stepDefinitions`:** Contains step definition classes implementing reusable steps.
  - **`utils`:** Contains utility classes for common functionalities.
- **`src/test/resources`:** Contains feature files written in Gherkin syntax.
  - **`features`:** Contains `.feature` files defining test scenarios.
- **`pom.xml`:** Maven project configuration file specifying dependencies and build settings.

## Writing Feature Files

Feature files are written in Gherkin syntax and are located in the `src/test/resources/features` directory. Each feature file represents a specific feature of the application and contains scenarios with given, when, and then steps.

Example Feature File (`login.feature`):
```gherkin
Feature: Login Functionality

  Scenario: Successful Login
    Given I navigate to the login page
    When I enter username "user123" and password "password123"
    And I click the login button
    Then I should be logged in successfully
```

## Writing Reusable Steps

Reusable steps are implemented as Java methods in the step definition classes located in the `src/test/java/stepDefinitions` directory. These steps can be reused across multiple feature files to promote code reusability and maintainability.

Example Step Definition (`LoginStepDefinitions.java`):
```java
public class LoginStepDefinitions {

    @Given("^I navigate to the login page$")
    public void navigateToLoginPage() {
        // Code to navigate to the login page
    }

    @When("^I enter username \"([^\"]*)\" and password \"([^\"]*)\"$")
    public void enterCredentials(String username, String password) {
        // Code to enter username and password
    }

    @When("^I click the login button$")
    public void clickLoginButton() {
        // Code to click the login button
    }

    @Then("^I should be logged in successfully$")
    public void verifyLoginSuccess() {
        // Code to verify successful login
    }
}
```
